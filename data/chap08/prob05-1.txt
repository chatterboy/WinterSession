just a smile and the rain is gone
can hardly believe it (yeah)
there's angel standing next to me
reaching for my heart

just a smile and there's no way back
can hardly believe it (yeah)
but there's an angel calling me
reaching for my heart

i know, that i'll be ok now
this time it's real

i lay my love on you
it's all i wanna do
every time i breathe i feel brand new
you open up my heart
show me all your love, and walk right through
as i lay my love on you
